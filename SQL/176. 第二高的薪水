Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

MS SQL SERVER:
1.
SELECT max(Salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee)

2.
SELECT TOP 1 a.Salary from (select distinct top 2 Salary from Employee order by Salary desc)a
SELECT TOP 1 a.Salary from (select top 2 b.Salary from (select distinct top 2 Salary from #Employee order by Salary desc)b order by b.Salary)a
MySQL:
SELECT (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary

① selete * from testtable limit 2,1;

② selete * from testtable limit 2 offset 1;
1.数据库数据计算是从0开始的

2.offset X是跳过X个数据，limit Y是选取Y个数据

3.limit  X,Y  中X表示跳过X个数据，读取Y个数据
