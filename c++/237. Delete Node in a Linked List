Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
             
             
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val = node->next->val;   //没有给出头指针，直接下一个节点的值赋值给该节点，然后改节点指向下下个节点
        ListNode *tmp = node->next;
        node->next = tmp->next;
        delete tmp;
    }
};
